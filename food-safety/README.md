# Food Safety Verification and Recall System

A blockchain-based solution for food product tracking, safety verification, and targeted recall management implemented using Clarity smart contracts on Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

The Food Safety Verification and Recall System provides a transparent, immutable record of food products throughout the supply chain, enabling rapid response to contamination events and building consumer trust through verifiable safety information.

This system addresses a critical public health concern affecting billions of people daily by creating end-to-end traceability for food products, from farm to table.

## Key Features

- **Batch Tracking**: Create digital identities for food batches with complete provenance data
- **Safety Monitoring**: Integrate with IoT sensors to monitor and record handling conditions
- **Rapid Recall System**: Enable targeted recalls of only affected products
- **Regulatory Access**: Secure, privileged access for food safety authorities
- **Consumer Verification**: Simple scanning to verify food safety status
- **Immutable Records**: Tamper-proof history of all safety tests and handling
- **Incentive Mechanisms**: Encourage immediate reporting of potential issues

## Contract Details

### food-safety-core.clar

The core contract manages system configuration, authentication, and provides a central event logging system. Key functions include:

- Role-based access control (owners, administrators, regulatory agencies)
- System status and version management
- Event logging with authorization controls
- Safety threshold configuration and verification

### batch-registry.clar (In Progress)

The batch registry contract tracks food batches through the supply chain with complete chain of custody. Will include:

- Batch registration with origin and production data
- Ownership transfers as products move through supply chain
- History tracking with timestamps and locations
- Batch metadata including product type, expiry dates, and certifications

### Additional Contracts (Planned)

- **Alert System**: Automated notifications for safety violations
- **Verification Oracle**: Integration with off-chain testing data
- **Recall Management**: Targeted recall workflows and tracking
- **Sensor Integration**: Connection to IoT devices and smart packaging

## Use Cases

1. **Contamination Response**: Enable rapid, targeted recalls of affected products
2. **Supply Chain Verification**: Provide transparency into product origins and handling
3. **Regulatory Oversight**: Streamline compliance verification and inspection
4. **Consumer Trust**: Allow end-users to verify safety of purchases
5. **Quality Assurance**: Monitor and enforce proper handling conditions throughout distribution
